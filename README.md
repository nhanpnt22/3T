## Overview

The **Triame(3T)** defines how the transformer (C) emerges from the summed tensor product of elements A and B:

```
C = ∑[B⊗A]
```

This model provides a new theoretical framework for understanding how mediating elements arise from the dynamic interaction of two primary elements, with applications across complex systems, engineering, and interdisciplinary research.
